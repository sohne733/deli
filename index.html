        <p class="hover-text1">I stepped into a deli on 1st Avenue and, after browsing for a moment, I decided to ask the owner if I could snap a quick photo of her deli. She smiled warmly and told me to go ahead, making me feel instantly at ease. What started as a simple request led to a longer conversation, where we ended up talking about her cat that freely roams around the store. It’s a lively little thing, always darting between shelves, adding character to the space.</p>
     <p class="hover-text2">As our chat continued, I shared with her the details of the publication I was working on for class, which focuses on the gestures of the city—the subtle moments that we often overlook but that make up the hidden beauty of New York. Her welcoming nature and the way her deli had its own rhythm and life felt like just one of those gestures. Moments like these remind me that there’s so much more to the city than what first meets the eye.</p>
